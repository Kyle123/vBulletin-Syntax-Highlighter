# vBulletin-Syntax-Highlighter
Very simple Chrome Extension that syntax highlights VBA code on vBulletin Sites

It adds bbcode tags to code snippets in VB6/VBA, attempts to recognise:
 - Strings & Comments
 - Functions
 - Keywords
 
Colours for the above are customizable through the options page of the extension.

Tags are added by highlighteing the code and hitting `Alt+a`.

Currently this only works for the "Enhanced" and "Simple Textbox" editors.
